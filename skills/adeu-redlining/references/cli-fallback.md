# Adeu CLI Reference (Fallback Path)

When the Adeu MCP tools are unavailable, drive Adeu via the `uvx adeu` CLI through Bash.

**The CLI is Python-only.** Adeu does not ship a Node CLI — only a Node MCP server (`@adeu/mcp-server`). If the user is on a Node-only setup and the MCP server isn't running, the right move is usually to suggest they install the MCP server (`npx -y @adeu/mcp-server`) rather than introduce a Python toolchain just for one-off CLI use. Only fall through to `uvx adeu` when the MCP path genuinely isn't an option.

If `uvx` is not available, install it once: `pip install uv` (or see https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

## Subcommands

### `adeu extract` — read a document

```bash
uvx adeu extract contract.docx -o contract.md
# Clean view (accepted state):
uvx adeu extract contract.docx --clean-view -o accepted.md
# Outline / appendix / search modes, mirroring read_docx:
uvx adeu extract contract.docx --mode outline
uvx adeu extract contract.docx --mode appendix
uvx adeu extract contract.docx --search-query "Governing Law"
# Machine-readable JSON envelope ({"markdown", "title", "file_path"}) on stdout:
uvx adeu extract contract.docx --json
```

Output is Markdown with CriticMarkup for tracked changes and comments. The same semantic appendix (defined terms, cross-refs, bookmarks) appears at the bottom. Long documents are paginated — pass `--page N` to continue reading.

### `adeu diff` — compare two versions

```bash
uvx adeu diff v1.docx v2.docx
```

Returns Adeu's `@@ Word Patch @@` sub-word diff. Not a unified diff.

### `adeu apply` — apply edits as tracked changes

```bash
uvx adeu apply contract.docx edits.json --author "Review Bot" -o contract_redlined.docx
# Machine-readable stats on stdout (recommended — parse it to verify your batch):
uvx adeu apply contract.docx edits.json --json
```

With `--json`, stdout carries the engine stats (`edits_applied`, `edits_skipped`, per-edit `edits[]` reports with CriticMarkup previews, `output_path`) and human logs are suppressed. A batch that fails validation prints `{"error": "batch_validation_failed", "errors": [...]}` and exits 1. Exit code 1 also signals a partially applied batch — check `edits_skipped`.

The `edits.json` file is a JSON array. Each entry has a `type` discriminator matching `process_document_batch` (see `references/mcp-tools.md` for the full shape):

```json
[
  {
    "type": "modify",
    "target_text": "State of New York",
    "new_text": "State of Delaware",
    "comment": "Standardizing governing law.",
    "match_mode": "strict"
  },
  {
    "type": "accept",
    "target_id": "Chg:7"
  },
  {
    "type": "reply",
    "target_id": "Com:3",
    "text": "Agreed — updated above."
  }
]
```

`accept` / `reject` / `reply` `target_id`s must come from an `adeu extract` run done *immediately before* generating `edits.json`. They are session-bound and shift every time the document state changes.

### `adeu sanitize` — strip metadata, optionally keep markup

```bash
# Full scrub:
uvx adeu sanitize redline.docx -o clean.docx --author "My Firm" --report

# Keep redline markup but redact author metadata:
uvx adeu sanitize redline.docx -o clean.docx --keep-markup --author "My Firm" --report
```

Use `--report` to print a sanitization report — useful for verifying what was removed.

### `adeu accept-all` — accept every change and drop every comment

```bash
uvx adeu accept-all redline.docx -o final.docx
# Default output is <input>_clean.docx; --json prints {"status": "ok", "output_path": ...}
uvx adeu accept-all redline.docx --json
# Accept the tracked changes but KEEP the comments (review still live)
uvx adeu accept-all redline.docx --no-remove-comments
```

Comment removal is **on by default** — the output is meant to be distributable. Every deleted comment is reported by id and author (`removed_comment_details` under `--json`); surface that to the user. Comments whose anchored text an accepted deletion consumes are removed either way.

## Workflow on the CLI path

1. `uvx adeu extract <doc> -o doc.md` — read it.
2. Construct `edits.json` based on what the user asked for.
3. `uvx adeu apply <doc> edits.json --author "<name>" -o <out>.docx --json` — parse the stats to confirm `edits_skipped == 0`.
4. `uvx adeu extract <out>.docx --clean-view -o verify.md` — verify by reading the clean view.

For ID-based operations (`accept`, `reject`, `reply`), step 1 and step 2 must be back-to-back. Do not reuse IDs across multiple `apply` runs.

## I/O contract

- **stdout** carries only document data or, with `--json`, one machine-readable JSON result. Redirecting stdout always yields a clean file.
- **stderr** carries all logs, warnings, and errors.
- **Exit codes**: `0` = full success; `1` = failure or partially applied batch.

## CLI vs MCP differences worth knowing

- **The CLI is Python-only.** Node users don't have a CLI equivalent — they should run the Node MCP server (`@adeu/mcp-server`) instead.
- The CLI operates on files. Live Word integration is not part of this slim fork.
- `mode="outline"` / `mode="appendix"` / search map to `adeu extract --mode outline`, `--mode appendix`, and `--search-query`.
