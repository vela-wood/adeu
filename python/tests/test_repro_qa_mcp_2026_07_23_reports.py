Repro tests for ADEU-MCP-QA-REPORT.md (2026-07-23, black-box QA of the Node
MCP server, v1.29.0+4bb70f9) — Python mirror.

Each Node finding below was re-verified against the Python engine / MCP tools
and encoded here only where it reproduces:

  F5   Unsupported markdown handled inconsistently:
       - hyperlink insertion is rejected with dead-end advice ("Use a
         dedicated structural operation." — no such operation exists for MCP
         callers), engine.py validate_edit_strings;
       - "- item" as a new paragraph half-applies: ListParagraph style with
         NO w:numPr (renders indented, bulletless, and the "- " marker is
         silently eaten on round-trip);
       - "* item" — the projection's OWN bullet syntax (AI_CONTEXT §13
         Lists) — also half-applies instead of producing a real bullet that
         re-reads as "* item".
       (The "only '1. ' converts to a list" rule of AI_CONTEXT §11 is
       deliberate and NOT contradicted here.)
  F6   Batch report previews are not faithful to the saved document:
       (1) match_mode="all" previews only the FIRST occurrence changed;
       (2) an older pending insertion renders as plain accepted text in a
           later edit's preview (clean-mapper fallback path);
       (3) same-author re-edit of a pending insertion previews as NESTED
           CriticMarkup {++...{++...++}...++}.
  F7   Batch report omits comments entirely (engine report dict AND the
       rendered process_document_batch response).
  F12  (a) sanitize --accept-all headline counts revision MARKS (deliberate
       unit, AI_CONTEXT 2026-07-22) but the report then LISTS fewer change
       items with no reconciliation — a fragmented revision (multi-paragraph
       insertion: paragraph-mark w:ins elements carry no text) makes the
       headline and the list disagree silently;
       (b) the accept_all_changes MCP tool removes all comment bodies but
       its response never mentions comments at all.
  F14  `adeu diff` on identical files prints only "Found 0 changes:" — no
       explicit no-differences statement.
  F15  compare_clean=False diffs split CriticMarkup tokens across output
       lines: a "+" payload line ends with an unclosed {>>...<<} block and
       bare continuation lines carry closers with no opener.

Verified NON-repros (no test):
  - F6(2) raw-match path: when the later edit's target resolves in the RAW
    view, _tidy_preview_context keeps complete {++...++} blocks intact — the
    defect is specific to the clean-mapper fallback (tested below).
  - F12(b) sanitize_docx: the sanitize report DOES disclose comment removal
    ("COMMENTS (stripped)" section with per-comment lines) — only the
    accept_all_changes tool response is silent (tested below).
  - F14 MCP tool: diff_docx_files already returns the explicit
    "No text differences found between the documents." — only the CLI lacks
    a statement (tested below).

Every test is written test-first: it fails on current main and passes once
the finding is fixed.
