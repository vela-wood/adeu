"""CC-1c — checkbox projection (A1.8).

A `w14:checkbox` control projects as the three-character token `[x]` or `[ ]`,
never as the raw ballot glyph. The node twin is
`node/packages/core/src/cc_checkboxes.test.ts`.

Two facts these tests encode came out of the COM reconnaissance against real
Word 16.0 rather than from the spec, and both are load-bearing:

* The mark is read from `w14:checked`, not from the glyph run. Word restores
  `w14:checked` when a checkbox toggle is REJECTED, so the attribute is the
  settled value; the glyph can lag it inside a tracked change.
* Word writes the glyph as literal `w:t` text, not `w:sym`. That is what makes
  the substitution one character for one character, so no offset arithmetic
  anywhere has to learn about a width difference.

The corpus supplied the trap in `test_bare_glyphs_outside_a_control_are_left_alone`:
of ~7,700 checkboxes across ten documents, every one is `w14:checkbox` and not
one is ticked — but `odot_uic_drywell` also carries two bare `U+2610` runs
sitting in ordinary prose, outside any control. A substitution keyed on the
character rather than on the control would invent two checkboxes there.
