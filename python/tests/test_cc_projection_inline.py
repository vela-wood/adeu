"""CC-1b — inline content-control projection (A1.2 partial, A1.4, A1.10).

Covers the inline half of A1: anchored leaf controls, flags, the empty-pair
edit surface and the placeholder bubble. Block-level anchors (CC:1), groups
(CC:8) and the table controls (CC:14-16) are still transparent and are asserted
as such below, so this file records exactly how far CC-1b has got rather than
quietly passing on a partial implementation.

The node twin is `node/packages/core/src/cc_projection_inline.test.ts`.
