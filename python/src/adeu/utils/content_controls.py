"""Content-control (``w:sdt``) classification and ordinal assignment.

Twin of ``node/packages/core/src/utils/content-controls.ts`` — every rule here
must hold identically in both engines (Virtual Text contract).

This lives in its own module rather than in ``utils/docx.py`` for two reasons:
``utils/docx.py`` is the most contended file in the tree (both agents touch it),
and keeping the classification rules in one small pair of files makes the
python/node diff reviewable by eye — which is how the twins are kept honest.

Namespaces are spelled in Clark notation directly instead of going through
``docx.oxml.ns.qn``: python-docx does not register ``w15``, and the only thing
that currently registers it is an import side effect in
``adeu.redline.comments``. Depending on import order for correctness of a
projection rule is not acceptable, so ``mapper.py``'s explicit-constant
precedent is followed here.
