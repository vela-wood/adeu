def renumber_snapshot_ids(doc) -> tuple[dict[str, str], dict[str, str]]:
    """
    Rewrites w:id attributes on a snapshot Document to mirror the disk path's
    two-pool numbering scheme:
      - w:ins / w:del elements form a sequential "Chg" pool starting at 1
      - w:comment elements form a separate sequential "Com" pool starting at 1

    Updates all cross-references so the document remains internally consistent:
      - w:commentReference, w:commentRangeStart, w:commentRangeEnd in document.xml
        get their w:id values remapped to the new Com pool
      - w15:p (legacy comment threading parent attribute) gets remapped
      - commentsExtended.xml's w15:paraIdParent linking is preserved verbatim
        because it's keyed by paraId (a separate identifier) — no remap needed

    Why: Live Word allocates IDs from a single shared counter for both revisions
    and comments. Disk path uses two independent counters. An agent that reads
    via the disk path and writes via Live Word (or vice versa) can target the
    wrong element because Com:N from one path may not match Com:N from the
    other. Renumbering the Live Word snapshot to match disk's two-pool scheme
    eliminates this collision (Bug 5).

    The remapping is fully deterministic: IDs are assigned in document order
    of the elements, so two reads of the same unmodified snapshot produce
    identical renumbered projections.

    Args:
        doc: a python-docx Document built from a Live Word snapshot.

    Returns:
        (chg_id_remap, com_id_remap): two dicts mapping original w:id strings
        to new w:id strings. Useful for callers that need to translate IDs
        across the renumber, though most consumers can ignore them — the
        mapper reads the renumbered IDs directly from the mutated doc.
